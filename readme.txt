Semonto watches the health of your website and server. Get notified when 
something is wrong, so you can fix the issue before anyone notices.

== Description ==

Semonto watches your website 24/7 and alerts you if there is a problem.
This way, you can fix the issue before anyone notices.

With Semonto, you can be sure that:
* Your website is up
* Pages are loading fast enough

* Your server is healthy

This WordPress plugin connects your website to Semonto.

You will also receive a monthly uptime report with a detailed 
performance of your website.
